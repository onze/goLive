== DESCRIPTION ==
goLive is an arcade oriented version of the classic go board game ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_board_game ). Classic rules are not followed that much, as I try to build a fast paced gameplay.

The game is in heavy development right now, and not currently playable.

A more detailed description can be found in the doc folder ( http://github.com/onze/goLive/blob/master/doc/golive.brainstorming.en.txt )

== REQUIREMENTS ==

the game uses the panda3d engine. you can get the runtime on panda3d's website ( http://www.panda3d.org/download.php?runtime ).

== INSTALLATION ==
